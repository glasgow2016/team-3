                    p.lead The blue men of the minch, also known as storm kelpies, are known to inhabit stretch of water between the northern Outer Hebrides and mainland Scotland.

                    p.lead Blue men look much like humans, and are about the same size, but have a blue hue to their skin. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they can be found sleeping on the surface of the water.

                    p.lead Blue men approach ships that journey through the Minch Strait, and call out in rhymes to their captains. If the captains cannot finish the rhyme, the blue men will sink the ship! Do you have what it takes to fend off the blue men?
